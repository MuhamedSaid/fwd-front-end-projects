# Landing Page Project

A simple project consisting of a **multi-section web page** and a **navigation bar** that
navigation bar contains links to each section which allow the user to easily interact with it.

When a user clicks on one of these links in the navbar the page scrolls to that specific section _smoothly_, also while the user
scrolling through the page the section which the user is currently at _shows some simple animation_.

Page also has scroll to top button, also if the page is not scrolled for 3 seconds, the navigation bar will be hidden until the page is scrolled again.
